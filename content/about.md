Hi! I'm rjindael (or rj). I've gone by a variety of aliases before on the internet. You've managed to stumble upon my website!

I'm a 15 year old programmer from the United States. In general, I'm a full-stack developer. I've had thorough experience in multiple languages, including C#, C/C++, PHP, JS/TS, Lua, and other numerous languages. I am also proficient in reverse engineering (.NET/Unity and C++ applications), backend and frontend website development (primarily with Laravel, but also express.js and vanilla PHP), system administration (Docker, setting up and securing Linux systems, CI/CD systems and management thereof), and more. Basically speaking, I am a swiss army knife when it comes to computers.

Otherwise, I maintain a hobby in election analysis, modeling, and mapping as well as political science.

# Contact

- **E-mail:** [rjindaal@pm.me](mailto:rjindaal@pm.me)
- **Telegram:** [@rjindael](https://t.me/rjindael)
- **GitHub:** [@rjindael](https://github.com/rjindael)
- **HackerOne:** [@rjindael](https://hackerone.com/rjindael?type=user)

If you're looking to speak to me, my preferred method of contact is either through my e-mail or starting a chat on Telegram.

For encrypted communication, ProtonMail is ostensibly end-to-end encrypted but you may also attach your PGP public key as per usual to your message. Telegram is not end-to-end encrypted by default but supports it through its ["secret chats"](https://telegram.org/faq#secret-chats). Both methods are just fine for secure communication, but if you absolutely must you may message me for my Signal.
